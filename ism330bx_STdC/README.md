# ISM330BX

The ISM330BX is a system-in-package featuring a high-performance 3-axis digital accelerometer and 3-axis digital gyroscope with up to three processing channels.

**Channel 1** has been designed for data processing for motion tracking and 3D spatial tracking. Acceleration and angular rate data are available on the primary output of the I²C / SPI / MIPI I3C® interface for the accelerometer and gyroscope with independent ODR and FS.

**Channel 2** has been designed for acceleration data only. Data are available on the TDM interface at 8 kHz or 16 kHz. Acceleration data made available through channel 2 have dedicated processing and filtering for those applications requiring ultralow noise (down to 30 μg/√Hz), linear phase, and low latency.

**Channel 3** is dedicated to the analog hub and Qvar, which is an electrical potential sensor able to measure the variation of the quasi-electrostatic potential.

The ISM330BX embeds an analog hub, which is able to connect an external analog input and convert it to a digital signal for processing, and includes advanced dedicated features like a finite state machine and data filtering for motion processing.

The event-detection interrupts enable efficient and reliable motion tracking and context awareness, implementing hardware recognition of free-fall events, 6D orientation, click and double-click sensing, activity or inactivity, stationary/motion detection and wake-up events. Machine learning and finite state machine processing allow moving some algorithms from the application processor to the ISM330BX sensor, enabling consistent reduction of power consumption.

Embedded FIFO with compression and dynamic allocation of significant data allows overall power saving of the system with a FIFO buffer size up to 4.5 KB.

The ISM330BX MEMS sensor module leverages the robust and mature in-house manufacturing processes already used for the production of micromachined accelerometers and gyroscopes. The various sensing elements are manufactured using specialized micromachining processes, while the IC interfaces are developed using CMOS technology that allows the design of a dedicated circuit, which is trimmed to better match the characteristics of the sensing element.

The ISM330BX is available in a small plastic, land grid array (LGA) package of 2.5 x 3.0 x 0.71 mm to address ultracompact solutions.
