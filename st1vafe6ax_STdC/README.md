# ST1VAFE6AX

The ST1VAFE6AX is a biosensor embedding a vAFE channel to detect biopotential signals and a 6-axis IMU featuring a high-performance 3-axis digital accelerometer and 3-axis digital gyroscope for motion tracking.

The device has been designed with a very compact, low-power vAFE with configurable input impedance. The vAFE enables reading analog signals that are complementary to motion signals. The vAFE and motion signals are intrinsically synchronous, so the result is a unique context-aware edge analysis, thus low power and with the minimum possible latency.

Easy integration and actual synchronization of the vAFE with the accelerometer sensor signal, allows standalone processing in MEMS sensors, leveraging the MEMS sensor embedded ecosystem, including FSM and MLC, offloading the microcontroller.

Biopotential and motion data are available on the I²C / SPI / MIPI I3C® interface.

The event-detection interrupts enable efficient and reliable motion tracking and context awareness, implementing hardware recognition of free-fall events, 6D orientation, click and double-click sensing, activity or inactivity, stationary/motion detection and wake-up events.

Embedded FIFO with compression and dynamic allocation of significant data allows overall power saving of the system with a FIFO buffer size up to 4.5 KB.

The ST1VAFE6AX MEMS sensor module leverages the robust and mature in-house manufacturing processes already used for the production of micromachined accelerometers and gyroscopes. The various sensing elements are manufactured using specialized micromachining processes, while the IC interfaces are developed using CMOS technology that allows the design of a dedicated circuit, which is trimmed to better match the characteristics of the sensing element.

The ST1VAFE6AX is available in a small plastic, land grid array (LGA) package of 2.5 x 3.0 x 0.71 mm to address ultracompact solutions.
