# LSM6DSV16B

The LSM6DSV16B is a system-in-package featuring a high-performance 3-axis digital accelerometer and 3-axis digital gyroscope with dual processing channels.

**Channel 1** has been designed for user interface data processing for motion tracking and 3D head tracking.  Acceleration and angular rate data are available on the primary output of the I²C / SPI / MIPI I3C® interface for the accelerometer and gyroscope with independent ODR and FS.

**Channel 2** has been designed for audio acceleration data processing for bone conduction and speech-enhanced applications. Data are available on the TDM interface at 8 kHz or 16 kHz.

The event-detection interrupts enable efficient and reliable motion tracking and context awareness, implementing hardware recognition of free-fall events, 6D orientation, click and double-click sensing, activity or inactivity, stationary/motion detection and wake-up events. Finite state machine processing allows moving some algorithms from the application processor to the LSM6DSV16B sensor, enabling consistent reduction of power consumption.

Embedded FIFO with compression and dynamic allocation of significant data allows overall power saving of the system with a FIFO buffer size up to 4.5 KB.

The LSM6DSV16B MEMS sensor module leverages the robust and mature in-house manufacturing processes already used for the production of micromachined accelerometers and gyroscopes. The various sensing elements are manufactured using specialized micromachining processes, while the IC interfaces are developed using CMOS technology that allows the design of a dedicated circuit, which is trimmed to better match the characteristics of the sensing element.

The LSM6DSV16B is available in a small plastic land grid array (LGA) package of 2.5 x 3.0 x 0.71 mm to address ultracompact solutions.
